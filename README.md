# Simple Todo App – Interview Assignment
### Technologies: Node.js + TypeScript, NO external dependencies
### Lightweight: gzipped size of generated javascript: 8K
### Time of completion: 1.5 days

This project is an interview assignment with the following requirements:

- User comes to main page and sees a list of todos.
- Creation/Updating/Deleteion must be done without page refresh.
- Size of js must be less then 50Mb (gzipped).
- Amount of dependencies must be minimal.
- Todos must be saved into SQLite database.
- Tables in DB must be created with migrations.

In this project I am featuring the following:

– Typescript and Node.js
– No external dependencies in server or client side code.
– Lightweight – Only 8K js
– Layered server architecture: router/view/model/sqlite layers.
– Fully Ajax driven – no page refresh
– Create/Read/Update/Delete features are in place and are RESTful
– All code is OOP
– In-house built simple migration feature that keeps track of order and version
– Secure. Access restricted to a clearly defined set of resources
– Settings, libraries, sqlite adapter are abstracted into separate classes
– Client side HTML is generated with JS class on–the–fly.
– Fast and furious time of completion of project: 1.5 days.
